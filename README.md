## Clone a repositoryUrl

Use these steps to clone from SourceTree, our client for using the repositoryUrl command-line free. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally. If you don't yet have SourceTree, [download and install first](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/). If you prefer to clone from the command line, see [Clone a repositoryUrl](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/4whODQ).

1. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll see the clone button under the **Source** heading. Click that button.
2. Now click **Check out in SourceTree**. You may need to create a SourceTree account or log in.
3. When you see the **Clone New** dialog in SourceTree, update the destination path and name if youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d like to and then click **Clone**.
4. Open the directory you just created to see your repositoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s files.

Now that you're more familiar with your Bitbucket repositoryUrl, go ahead and add a new file locally. You can [push your change back to Bitbucket with SourceTree](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/iqyBMg), or you can [add, commit,](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/8QhODQ) and [push from the command line](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/NQ0zDQ).
